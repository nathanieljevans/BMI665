HW # 2 Write-up 


This homework assignment requires internet connection, python3 and a bash terminal to run properly. 

To run this hw’s scripts, first navigate in a bash terminal to the directory containing “evans_hw2.sh” and “evans_analyze_wine.py” and execute the following command: 

$./evans_hw2.sh

The execution of this script will produce 3 directories with the following file structure: 
- download
o winequality_red.csv
o winequality_white.csv
- data
o wq_red.csv 
o wq_white.csv
o red_wine_good.csv
o red_wine_poor.csv
o white_wine_good.csv
o white_wine_poor.csv
- results 
o avg_wine_dict.pkl 

The pickled file saved in results has the structure: 

Top_level_dictionary
       keys: “red_wine_good”, “red_wine_poor”, 
       “white_wine_good”, “white_wine_poor” 
       
==> inner_dictionary
   keys: “chlorides”, “pH”, “alcohol”, “citric acid”
		
		>>> average value

Relevant data can be accessed via python (once loaded back into memory) by:

avg_chloride_good_red_wine = avg_wine_dict[“red_wine_good”][“chlorides”]

The bash script that was used to produce these results followed the general workflow: 
==> download data from remote repository 
==> format data 
==> select relevant data components 
==> process data (via python) and produce .pkl file with results
